**Immediate (NOW):**
- Create checkbox to check update on startup.
- Save settings and settings manager to store update preferences.
- Create button to check for update manually.
- Refactor CSV reader/writer, mainwindow. Apply single source of truth. Centralise filepath and make these classes get filepath from filmRecordmanager instead of each class has its own filepath string object.

**Upcoming (SOON):**
- If button is disabled, grayscale the icon.
- If a film has incorrect or empty release year or rating, display unassigned decade/rating statistic.
- If release year or watch date is icorrect (unassigned from above), make the cell red but only after deselecting it, not in the middle of adding.
- Clear all and autosave can result in losing all data if uncareful.
	- Clear all and save should save current list as archived list to easy find if accidental loss.
- Search option to find film titles.

**Future Plans (FUTURE):**
- Decide what settings are embedded in exe, which are in settings and which are in config file.
- Enable default file locations for Open/Save operations.
- Disable non-functional buttons.
- Automatically update statistics after each modification.
- Require confirmation for cell changes.
- Implement 'Enter' key navigation between cells.
- Include buttons to open, save, and save changes in different locations.
- Ensure integrity of dates, preventing backward progression.
- Prepare the program for release, including executable creation with jlink.
- Perform duplicate checks for entered titles and release years.
- Enable actions on multiple selected rows: Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete.
- Consider implementing shortcut keys and an undo feature.
- Explore learning opportunities with Hibernate and Spring frameworks.
- When cell selected, mouse wheel changes year, date, rating.
- In settings, user can choose rating system, max 4, 5, maybe 10 stars.
- Rating system will affect GUI and other things.
- When entering film title, show propositions in case film already in list.
- Selecting a yearly/decadal row would highlight the rows in main datagrid.
- (big) Reorganise how film records are stored. When adding a film record, editing release year or watch date, it assigns a film to proper statistics group.
	- This will work much faster than current solution. Currently all lists and maps are made with each change.
- A link to imdb film. (new property in filmrecord model)
- Colour cells depending on change. New cells green, modified blue, removed red.
