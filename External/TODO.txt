**Immediate (NOW):**
- Refactor CSV reader/writer, mainwindow. Apply single source of truth. Centralise filepath and make these classes get filepath from filmRecordmanager instead of each class has its own filepath string object.
- Rename folder versions into version screentshots or something similar.
- Create folder with different versions of a program.
- There is dll config file and pdb filer in the publish output folder, however the program runs fine without those files. Check what they are and why they are in the output.
- (maybe) Capture a snapshot each time you open a csv/txt. The program can be buggy and sometimes can overwrite or not save data properly.
	- Create a folder of snapshot files each time you open a file. Limit the number of snapshots to maybe 10 per folder. Also add option to disable in settings and settings manager to store it.

**Upcoming (SOON):**
- If button is disabled, grayscale the icon.
- If a film has incorrect or empty release year or rating, display unassigned decade/rating statistic.
- If release year or watch date is icorrect (unassigned from above), make the cell red but only after deselecting it, not in the middle of adding.
- Clear all and autosave can result in losing all data if uncareful.
	- Clear all and save should save current list as archived list to easy find if accidental loss.
- Search option to find film titles.

**Future Plans (FUTURE):**
- Decide what settings are embedded in exe, which are in settings and which are in config file.
- Enable default file locations for Open/Save operations.
- Disable non-functional buttons.
- Automatically update statistics after each modification.
- Require confirmation for cell changes.
- Implement 'Enter' key navigation between cells.
- Include buttons to open, save, and save changes in different locations.
- Ensure integrity of dates, preventing backward progression.
- Prepare the program for release, including executable creation with jlink.
- Perform duplicate checks for entered titles and release years.
- Enable actions on multiple selected rows: Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete.
- Consider implementing shortcut keys and an undo feature.
- Explore learning opportunities with Hibernate and Spring frameworks.
- When cell selected, mouse wheel changes year, date, rating.
- In settings, user can choose rating system, max 4, 5, maybe 10 stars.
- Rating system will affect GUI and other things.
- When entering film title, show propositions in case film already in list.
- Selecting a yearly/decadal row would highlight the rows in main datagrid.
- (big) Reorganise how film records are stored. When adding a film record, editing release year or watch date, it assigns a film to proper statistics group.
	- This will work much faster than current solution. Currently all lists and maps are made with each change.
- A link to imdb film. (new property in filmrecord model)
- Colour cells depending on change. New cells green, modified blue, removed red.
